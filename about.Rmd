**My Hometown and Background:** I was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, 20 minutes outside of the political capital of the world (Washington, D.C.). My family is originally from central Thailand.

**Previously,** I studied public health science and statistics at the University of Maryland, College Park. Postgraduation, I transitioned to a research assistant at UMD SPH for a year.

I am **currently** a graduate student at Columbia University studying biostatistics. 

You can find me...
  
  * cheering on (and attempting to mimic) **Chelsea FC** and **Max Verstappen**.
  
  * discovering the best **Thai food** in NYC,
  
  * hopefully adding more volume to my **gym routine**,
  
  * and laughing at **cat videos**.
